# YHCR-Demonstration 
Main repo for YHCR visualization code

Data folder is ignored in the push. So the first thing you have to do after cloning this repo is to copy and paste the folder with its name as 'data' to this directory. That data folder should contain the following three data files for this code to run:
 - data.json
 - t2dcomorbids_lineage.csv
 - YHCR_Diabetes_Comorbidities.csv
